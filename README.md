## Property Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project uses **Linear Regression** and other **machine learning techniques** to predict property prices based on key housing features such as lot size, construction year, basement area, number of floors, and overall quality.  

The goal is to understand how different property attributes influence the final sale price and to build a model capable of making accurate price predictions for new listings.  

### Key Steps:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, outliers, and skewed data  
- **Feature Engineering** – selected and scaled important features  
- **Model Building** – implemented Linear Regression and evaluated performance using metrics like **R²**, **RMSE**, and **MAPE**  
- **Visualization** – used correlation heatmaps and scatter plots to understand feature relationships  

### Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
